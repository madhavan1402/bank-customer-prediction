# 🤖 Predictive Modeling on Bank Marketing Dataset

> 📈 A machine learning project focused on predicting customer responses using classification models.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **machine learning techniques** to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their banking and personal data.

The process includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Training classification models
- Evaluating model performance using various metrics

The goal is to use historical marketing data to build a robust model that can generalize well to unseen data.
